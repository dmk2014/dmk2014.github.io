My name is Darren - I am a software developer from Ireland. Since 2015, I have worked for a company called [Diomac](http://www.diomac.com). In the past year I have helped the company branch into mobile development, releasing a mobile application (built atop Ionic and Angular) on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/diomac-go/id1116137095) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.diomaclite411720). Recently, I have spent some time learning TypeScript and have applied this knowledge to migrate our reporting library from JavaScript. I am also working on building new reporting functionality atop Angular 2 which will integrate with our main software product.

I graduated with a degree in Computing with Software Development from the [Tralee Institute of Technology](http://www.ittralee.ie/) in 2015. I achieved a first class honors. My final year project focused on the area of facial recognition. I built a proof of concept application to demonstrate facial detection, depth filtering of an image and photometric facial recognition. The software implementation is available to view on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dmk2014/FYP). A PDF copy of my accompanying thesis is available [here](/resources/thesis.pdf).

I am a passionate 'computer person'! My current rig is powered by i5-3570K @ 3.8GHz (due an upgrade) and MSI's GTX970. In software, I relish solving large scale problems by dividing them into small and simple modules. I am interested in working with modern languages, tools, technologies and frameworks.
