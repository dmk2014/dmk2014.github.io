My name is Darren - I am a software developer from Ireland. Since 2015, I have worked for a company called [Diomac](http://www.diomac.com). In the past year I have helped the company branch into mobile development, releasing a mobile application (built atop Ionic and Angular) on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/diomac-go/id1116137095) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.diomaclite411720). I have worked on migrating some of our existing products from JavaScript to TypeScript as well as building modern applications using Angular 2 that integrate with our main software product.

I am well versed in various languages and tools. Recently, I have spent a lot of time working with TypeScript, .NET and SQL. I am a huge fan of TypeScript. It has allowed us to develop maintainable, large-scale applications that run in the browser. The future is very interesting - frameworks such as Electron mean we can now develop and deploy applications to all major operating systems from a single codebase. In general, I relish solving large scale problems by dividing them into smaller, simpler modules. I am most interested in working with modern languages, tools, technologies and frameworks.

I graduated with a degree in Computing with Software Development from the [Tralee Institute of Technology](http://www.ittralee.ie/) in 2015. I achieved a first class honors. My final year project focused on the area of facial recognition. I built a proof of concept application to demonstrate facial detection, depth filtering of an image and photometric facial recognition. The software implementation is available to view on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dmk2014/FYP). A PDF copy of my accompanying thesis is available [here](/resources/thesis.pdf).

I am passionate about technology and have built my own computers from a young age. My current rig is powered by an i5-3570K (due an upgrade) and MSI's GTX970. In my free time I enjoy spending time with friends and family, fitness activities, watching basketball, gaming (not as much as I used to, unfortunately!) and reading.
